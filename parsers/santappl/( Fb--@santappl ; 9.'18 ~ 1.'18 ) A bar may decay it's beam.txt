Align to a rhythm (twisting it with Keeno Bristol sessions ep. 19 at 1:00:59
... update: he seems to have been mixing his Fading Fast VIP track on almost every episode

Keeno pause markup xml: <Keeno_BMS${Episode}/>
Keeno overlay markup xml: <Keeno_BMS${Episode}><Keeno_BMS${Episode}/>
Longer pause: <Pause/>

-------------------

A bar may decay its beam,
Into a peculiar steaming mix
Aquest if fortunately in a team

Dimming the underlying kicks,
A haystack of quirky nature's tricks,
Sound to see in a wavy texture

Picks what one will know at best,
!! a possibility to attest to,
Before laying rest, nesting !! a <Keeno>form in a scripture</Keeno>

Long before knowing it grows,
<Keeno/> too far ahead for !!today's sense not to roast
Some to envy and the rest to host!!
As creatures !!turn into dust, it becomes a must to know!!
For some to hold and gold for others to adore

God no, <Pause/> he wants more
Get him to sedation,
as one can see but it's not in vain to ask
Is this an innocent innovation, revelation

Attention it slips, slips and skips what it should not,
Creating one more loop like this to know,
Too hot to search, to cherish and the worse, to adore
<Keeno/> !!-!!

T's just words to us who want it done in an open manner,
until we all learn to see it through, else it's gone, <Pause/> for me, <Pause/> too

-----------------

Seems to work out with Keeno's intermezzos and some pauses, too. Thank you and good night
