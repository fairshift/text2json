# Features in priority (= clusters of functionalities)
— Wrapper functions (tyt & ty)
— Expressions with priority:
	Line, Sentence, Paragraph, Heading, …
	… possibly best to resolve with "markdown-it" package (without the nicer XML parser codification ; temporarily?), also because of tyt & ty compatibility with external parsers (at stage of tokenizing)
— Parsers with priority: 
	Article with MarkDown (abbr.: md), ValuesRhizome, G-Rhymes
	… with: json-schema
