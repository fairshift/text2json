# text2json â€” customizable parser with an optional Markdown capability
[Repository: github/fairshift/text2json](https://github.com/fairshift/text2json)

Starting simple...


To publish on npmjs.com/package/text2json


Internationalization of messages for guided input templates and schema mismatch can be provided by specific parsers (in format used also by "intl" and "react-intl" npm packages)...

Anyway, it's nice to know there's a way to do work while not having computer on shoulders.

What do you do with a parser package? Is it to measure something? And what do you do with node.js(i might have heard of it once) and ssr?
In any way that sounds like alot at once
oh, yes, channeling creativity hits the nail with the hammer.. though i study bioinformatics and seem stuck with the difficulty, even though i want to do it

Yes, I would like to have a general implementation which parses .md, text and data trees, looking for needles in hierarchical and flat data and maybe microdata formats. Measuring is by necessity or lack thereof maybe done in comparison with markets, which either flaunt data or don't, which is proven by the consumers who type in or scan their receipts. I don't do visual computing, though. SSR is there to bring stuff quicker to the screen, Node.js does it, besides packaging JavaScript and resources.
I just made a screenshot at this point, which has enough data in filename to get back to it at a later point, by parser retrieving and outputting JSON schematized data :smiley:",
